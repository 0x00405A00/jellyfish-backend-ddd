# jellyfish-backend-ddd

## Intro ##
Recreation of Jellyfish Backend for the Messaging Application Jellyfish for Android and iOS.
The Backend is fully designed and developed in **domain driven design** with **clean architecture**.
Communication from presentation to application over Meditr. library with command-query separation (cqs).
Currently the application is running as monolith, but the current architecture allows it to switch very fast to microservice with api gateway (ocelot, yarp etc.),command-query responsibility segregation and background database sync processed between read/write databases (optimistic locking with rowversioning) and ampq communication over rabbitmq to handle events over queues or publish/subscibe behaviours.




## Technology Stack ##
Backend  		| Web-Frontend			| Mobile Application
------------- 	| -------------		| -------------
C#/NET 7  		| C#/NET 7 			| C#/NET 7
ASP NET  		| Blazor Server 	| .NET MAUI
MySql 8.0.35   	| Razor Pages 		| 
SignalR  		| Mudblazor UI Components (https://mudblazor.com/) 	| 
Docker  		| 
EF Core  		| 

Note: Messaging Mobile App (will be added soon and is part of another repo that is currently private).

## Testing ##
Unit testing is my common way to test my methods and process flows.
Preface: I know not every method is testet, the reason why is: you can over engeneer and you can over test. My common way is the middle of path. Critical processes and flows or methods will be tested.
The unittest behaviour is: `arrange, act, assertion`. The common way in softwaretesting.

For end to end tests I used Postman with an import of generated swagger api documentation.

## Documentation ##
Currently only EER and Swagger Documentation.

## Deployment ##
Legacy over binary or with docker container.

## Motivation ##
The motivation for this project is to test NET MAUI on the upper named mobile platforms.
A side effect of this project is to give everyone the oportunity to host a messaging infrastructure by your own.
Without big amount of used hardware resources e.g. running the infrastructure on raspberry pi.

## Future ##
The security aspect is important too:
The last steps before the first prod version will be the implementation of end to end encryption and the protection of privacy for each user through forgetable
payload pattern.
Anorher **future** sight is the implementation of **artificial inteligence (AI)** support bots with google llama or chatgpt and the opportunity **to host the infrastructure in blockchain**.
