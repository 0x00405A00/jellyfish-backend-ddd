# jellyfish-backend-ddd

Recreation of Jellyfish Backend for the Messaging Application Jellyfish for Android and iOS.
The Backend is fully written in domain driven design with clean architecture.
Following tech stack is used:

- Backend:
-> C#/NET 7
-> ASP NET 
-> MySql with EF Core
-> SignalR

- Webfrontend:
-> C#/NET
-> Blazor Server
-> Razor Pages
-> Mudblazor UI Components

- Messaging Mobile App (will be added soon and is part of another repo that is currently private):
-> C#/NET 7
-> NET MAUI

The motivation for this project is to test NET MAUI on the upper named mobile platforms.
A side effect of this project is to give everyone the oportunity to host a messaging infrastructure by your own.
Without big amount of used hardware resources e.g. running the infrastructure on raspberry pi.

The security aspect is important to:
The last steps before the first prod version will be the implementation of end to end encryption and the protection of privacy for each user through forgetable
payload pattern.
Anorher future sight is the implementation of artificial inteligence (AI) support bots with google llama or chatgpt and the opportunity to host the infrastructure in blockchain.


Stay tuned.
